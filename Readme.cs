    @Version:   1.2

    @Change-Log:
                v1.2:		Added Auto Retract and Extend support
                v1.1:		Bug-fix INI related
                v1.0:		Initial Release

    @Arguments:
        This script understands the following arguments
            reset   - This resets all internal caches.
                      Run this if you add/remove or change piston settings
            clear   - This clears the programmable block message panel
                      for development use

    @Usage:
        Add (and edit) the following to the custom data of any piston you wish to add script functionality

        [Piston Settings]
        RetractSpeed=1
        ExtendSpeed=1
        AutoRetract=False
        AutoExtend=False

    @Note:
        RetractSpeed - The speed (in m/s) the piston should move during Retraction
        ExtendSpeed  - The speed (in m/s) the piston should move during Extension
        AutoRetract  - Should the piston automatically retract once at full extension
        AutoExtend   - Should the piston automatically extend once at full retraction

    
        You MUST either recompile the script,
        or run with argument "reset"
        to populate piston cache
